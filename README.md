"Predicting Soccer Match Results in the English Premier League" by Ben Ulmer:

The study aimed to predict the results of soccer matches in the English Premier League using machine learning models. The authors faced challenges such as the randomness of soccer data and the lack of injury information for players. Features such as whether a team is home or away, team Elo rankings, and recent results were used for feature selection. The authors also tested various models including a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, Naive Bayes, a hidden Markov model, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel. They managed to achieve about 50% accuracy when predicting whether the match was a win loss or a tie. The authors suggested that more advanced methods of feature selection and data preprocessing may improve the accuracy of the predictions.

"A Comparative Study on Neural Network Based Soccer Result Prediction" by Burak Galip Aslan and Mustafa Murat Inceoglu

Traditional methods of predicting soccer matches rely on statistical models, however the black box approach has proven to be better. The authors of the paper compared different models, including one by Cheng et. al. that uses a hybrid neural network, and their black box method was significantly better than the other methods. One thing the paper highlights is the importance of input data. More specifically, they note 'The available data should be transformed into alternative formats... It may not be necessary to apply any available data in the form of input parameters' (Aslan and Inceoglu).

"Predicting Wins, Losses and Attributesâ€™ Sensitivities in the Soccer World Cup 2018 Using Neural Network Analysis" by Amr Hassan et. al.

This paper analyzes data from the 2018 World Cup to create a model for predicting match results using supervised learning. The model is based on "Radial basis function using 75 attributes". The authors were able to achieve a win rate of 83.3% and a loss rate of 72.7% using key attributes such as Total Team Medium Pass Attempted (MBA) and the Distance Covered Team Average in zone 3.

"Football Match Result Prediction Using Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Tiwari, Sardar, & Jain, 2020 8th International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization

This paper uses data from the 2010-11 through 2017-18 seasons of the English Premier League. It employs recurrent neural networks with LSTM cell modifications to predict the outcome of soccer matches.
