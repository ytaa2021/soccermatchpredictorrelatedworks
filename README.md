"Predicting Soccer Match Results in the English Premier League" by Ben Ulmer:
The study aimed to predict the results of soccer matches in the English Premier League using machine learning models. The authors faced challenges such as the randomness of soccer data and the lack of injury information for players. Features such as whether a team is home or away, team Elo rankings, and recent results were used for feature selection. The authors also tested various models including a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, Naive Bayes, a hidden Markov model, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel. They managed to achieve about 50% accuracy when predicting whether the match was a win loss or a tie. The authors suggested that more advanced methods of feature selection and data preprocessing may improve the accuracy of the predictions.
